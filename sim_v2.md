aims of sim_v2:
- firstly, get a 2dim particle object done. very simple, barebones, but works. no complex numbers yet
    - position (x,y)
    - velocity (vx,vy)
    - (+) mass (m) (measured in u)Just 
- then, very simple bound collision. the particle should collide properly within certain bounds on the cartesian plane
- after this, simple particle-particle collision. maybe 2 or 3 particles at a time
